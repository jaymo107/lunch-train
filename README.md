-------

#### Inspired by the [Lunch train slack app](https://slack.com/apps/A1BES823B-lunch-train).

Just a throwaway app to lean about the T3 stack, most notibly [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) (which is actually amazing btw) with Prisma and NextJS.

Using the `create-t3-app` starter cli, found at [Init.tips](https://init.tips/)
